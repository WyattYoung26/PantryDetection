# üõí Pantry Item Tracker using YOLO and Object Detection

## üìã Overview  
This project leverages **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** object detection, a camera, and real-time tracking to manage pantry inventory.  
The system monitors:  
- **Item usage** (tracking when items are removed or returned).  
- **Shelf life** (alerting when items approach expiration).  
- **Smart inventory updates** through a camera feed to ensure your pantry stays organized and well-stocked.

## ‚ú® Features  
- **Real-time object detection:**  
   - Utilizes **YOLO** to detect and track pantry items with high accuracy.  
- **Shelf life monitoring:**  
   - Tracks expiration dates and sends alerts for items nearing their expiration.  
- **Item status updates:**  
   - Automatically logs when items are removed or returned to the pantry.  
- **Camera integration:**  
   - Uses a live camera feed to detect any changes in item placement.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once):** Deep learning model for real-time object detection.  
- **OpenCV:** Library for real-time computer vision and capturing the camera feed.  
- **Python:** Core language for integrating the YOLO model with the camera feed.  
- **TensorFlow/Keras (optional):** To train or fine-tune custom object detection models if needed.

## üß© How It Works  

1. **Camera Setup:**  
   - A camera is installed to monitor pantry shelves, streaming a continuous video feed to the system.  

2. **Object Detection:**  
   - The YOLO model identifies and labels pantry items in the camera feed.  
   - Detected items are logged with key information like their **name** and **position** on the shelf.  

3. **Tracking Shelf Life:**  
   - The system can associate expiration dates with items, keeping track of how long they‚Äôve been in the pantry.  
   - Alerts are triggered when an item approaches its expiration date.  

4. **Item Movement Detection:**  
   - When an item is removed or placed back, the system automatically updates the inventory status.  
   - This provides real-time tracking of pantry usage.

## üöÄ Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- **Camera or Webcam:** For capturing the pantry shelves in real time.  
- **Python 3.x:** Install it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
- **Dependencies:** Install the required libraries using:

    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python-headless tensorflow numpy
    ```

- **YOLO Weights and Config Files:**  
   Download the pre-trained YOLO model weights and config files from [YOLO official site](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) or [OpenCV GitHub](https://github.com/opencv/opencv).
